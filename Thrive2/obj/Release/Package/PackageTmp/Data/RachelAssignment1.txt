Q1: Most of the time, how do you find yourself working with different people in your work?
I can find the good in even the most disagreeable people. I can find something positive in even the most difficult situations. When times get tough, I turn to friends or family for support.

Q2: How do you find about the friendship, loyalty and selfless activities?
There is no point in maintaining close friendships; nothing lasts forever. I know how to calm myself down and relax when my life gets too hectic. Given the choice, I think that the majority of people would choose to do good rather than evil. I would only quit my job if I would already found another one to replace it.

Q3: After ending up single (once again), a friend decides to fix you up on a blind date. She states with absolute self-assurance that it is a match made in heaven. How would you react?
I would not even bother going because I am sure I will end up terribly disappointed. But I may be totally excited and would really look forward to meeting my dream date.
